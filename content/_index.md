## About me

My name is Frederico Sabino and I'm a Software Engineer currently based in Berlin, Germany.

I work on open source software with a focus on backend services which support the infrastructure behind the [Safe Wallet](https://safe.global).

I have previously worked on developing native Android applications at N26 and Gnosis.

## Tech

My main interests are around building scalable web applications and managing CI/CD pipelines for those applications.

When it comes to tech stacks, I have particular interest in writing applications in Rust or Java. 
More recently I have been launching production services running on Node.js with Typescript. From time to time I also reach out to Python
for some scripting needs.
